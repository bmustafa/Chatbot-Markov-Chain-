This was a homework assignment of mine, coded in Ruby.

Homework 3 is a Markov Chain Text generator class. It is capable of mimicing the speech of a body of text.

Homework 4 is a Chatbot using the Markov Chain Text generator class. Try using it, it is farely intuitive.
N gram is hard coded to two.

I have provided Moby Dick and Pride and Prejudice as text files to feed the chatbot for it to learn. The Chatbot will also pick up
on sentences and grammar used by the user. Read the other README for more details concerning the Project.
